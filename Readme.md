## Background

I am a full stack software developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy where I learned programming concepts such as MVC, OOP, Design Process, TDD and Agile Development.

I am a self-led and self-motivated learner, having taught myself and become proficient in Python, Ruby and Javascript before attending the course. 

After enjoying a successful career as a musician for Sony Music and as a producer for Sony/ATV as well as a short stint working as a property manager, I chose to seek new challenges by pursuing a career in tech which follows a life long interest in software development.

## Skills

**Leadership and Communication** <br>
Coming from a creative background as a music producer, it was my job to direct the composition of a song from initial melody all the way to a finalised track ready for release on TV, radio and streaming platforms. I coordinated singers, song-writers, session musicians and sound engineers to create songs that were then presented to A&R's and music industry executives before releasing the final product. My leadership and communication skills were vital in achieving this and as such clients of mine came from all three of the big major record labels: Sony Music, Warner and Universal.

**Flexible, Astute and Self-Led Learner** <br>
Having always had an interest in software development, I decided in late 2018 to take the plunge and start learning. I started watching youtube channels such as Traversy Media and The Coding train as well as took online courses on Codecademy and Coursera. Fast forward six months later and I found myself working for a tech startup based in Lagos, Nigeria. This was all accomplished through self-motivated, independent learning, a skill that I intend to carry through into future roles.

**Problem Solving** <br>
From solving katas on Codewars and LeetCode to finding creative solutions to issues I have faced while working on a product, I am an methodical problem solver and have formed a growing list of strategies to overcome problems I encounter. [A good example would be how I rotated IP addresses to proxy each HTTP request while scraping data from the web to avoid detection.](https://github.com/bibbycodes/soccer_scraper/blob/master/soccer.py)

**Interpersonal Skills** <br>
Coming from a rich cultural and professional background, I have gained excellent interpersonal skills that allow me to work effectively with people from a diverse set of cultures and backgrounds. I have lived and worked in 3 countries outside of the UK which has led me to interacting and workiing side by side with people of multiple backgrounds and cultures, often with vast language barriers between us.

**Software and Technologies** <br>
Python, Javascript, Ruby, SQL, HTML, CSS, Selenium Automation, Logic, Reason, Ableton, Cubase, Pro-tools, VSCode, Figma, Postman and TablePlus.
